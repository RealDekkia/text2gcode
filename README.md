# text2gcode

This is a work in progress tool to convert text into gcode.
Currently it only supports Capital-Letters and only works on my printer with my exact setup

## Future stuff:

- I will add options to change all the stuff you need to use it on your printer
- There will be a GUI

## Letter Support:

There will be support for the following:
    
* All printable ASCII Letters
* A small subset of ANSI
* Some letters like "│", "─" or "┬" to make tables
* An option to change the existing characters and/or add your own
